# portfolio

This is the portfolio website that I am using now. The finished version can be found by clicking the gh-pages branch or go to www.nemosattic.life. 

I used a template to create it but heavily modified it. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I only needed to change some of the HTML and Bootstrap to get it the way that I wanted. I needed a quick solution and this was the best for my time crunch. 

If you plan to download this project so that you can use the template, you are free to do so, but know that part of the license is that you must keep the attribution at the end of the index.html page.
